Hi, I'm Harry. Currently,
I'm a full-stack developer at Lancaster University.
I have 3 years of experience with .NET technologies and 2 years of experience with JS frameworks such as React and AngularJS. 

My works involved talking with stakeholders and product owner to define requirements,
implementing back-end API,
design and implement web and mobile front-end.
I also take care of the module design and documentation.
Sometimes, I do pair programming and code review with junior developers to keep our code consistent and well-maintained.
