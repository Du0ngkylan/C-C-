NO MORE CHAMPAGNE 
AND THE FIREWORKS ARE THROUGH 
HERE WE ARE, ME AND YOU 
FEELING LOST AND FEELING BLUE 
IT'S THE END OF THE PARTY 
AND THE MORNING SEEMS SO GREY 
SO UNLIKE YESTERDAY 
NOW'S THE TIME FOR US TO SAY 

HAPPY NEW YEAR 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
MAY WE ALL HAVE A VISION NOW AND THEN 
OF A WORLD WHERE EVERY NEIGHBOR IS A FRIEND 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
MAY WE ALL HAVE OUR HOPES, OUR WILL TO TRY 
IF WE DON'T WE MIGHT AS WELL LAY DOWN AND DIE 
YOU AND I 

SOMETIMES I SEE 
HOW THE BRAVE NEW WORLD ARRIVES 
AND I SEE HOW IT THRIVES 
IN THE ASHES OF OUR LIVES 
OH YES, MAN IS A FOOL 
AND HE THINKS HE'LL BE OKAY 
DRAGGING ON, FEET OF CLAY 
NEVER KNOWING HE'S ASTRAY 
KEEPS ON GOING ANYWAY 

HAPPY NEW YEAR 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
MAY WE ALL HAVE A VISION NOW AND THEN 
OF A WORLD WHERE EVERY NEIGHBOR IS A FRIEND 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
MAY WE ALL HAVE OUR HOPES, OUR WILL TO TRY 
IF WE DON'T WE MIGHT AS WELL LAY DOWN AND DIE 
YOU AND I 

SEEMS TO ME NOW 
THAT THE DREAMS WE HAD BEFORE 
ARE ALL DEAD, NOTHING MORE 
THAN CONFETTI ON THE FLOOR 
IT'S THE END OF A DECADE 
IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS TIME 
WHO CAN SAY WHAT WE'LL FIND 
WHAT LIES WAITING DOWN THE LINE 
IN THE END OF EIGHTY-NINE 

HAPPY NEW YEAR 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
MAY WE ALL HAVE A VISION NOW AND THEN 
OF A WORLD WHERE EVERY NEIGHBOR IS A FRIEND 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
HAPPY NEW YEAR 
MAY WE ALL HAVE OUR HOPES, OUR WILL TO TRY 
IF WE DON'T WE MIGHT AS WELL LAY DOWN AND DIE 
YOU AND I
